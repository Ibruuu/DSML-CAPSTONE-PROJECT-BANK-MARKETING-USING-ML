# DSML-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-BANK-MARKETING-USING-ML
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the success of a bank's marketing campaign, specifically focusing on whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit after being contacted through a marketing campaign. The project aims to achieve the following goals:

1.Predict Customer Behavior:
Develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic, social, and economic features.

2.Improve Marketing Efficiency:
By predicting which customers are most likely to respond positively to marketing efforts, the bank can target the right audience, reduce costs, and optimize its marketing strategy.

3.Data Analysis and Insights:
Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in customer data. This analysis will help better understand customer preferences and behavior, providing valuable insights for marketing teams.

4.Model Comparison and Optimization:
Implement several machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. The goal is to select the best-performing model for future campaigns.

5.Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing:
Address data quality issues such as missing values and categorical variables, and create meaningful features that improve model performance. The preprocessing pipeline will prepare the data for accurate and effective machine learning training.

6.Business Impact:
By applying machine learning to predict customer behavior, the project aims to significantly improve the bankâ€™s marketing outcomes. A successful campaign prediction model can lead to increased customer acquisition, higher returns on investment, and more efficient use of marketing resources.
